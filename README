Library-CallNumber-LC

Library::CallNumber::LC is mostly designed to do call number normalization, with the following goals:

    * The normalized call numbers are comparable with each other, for proper sorting
    * The normalized call number is a short as possible, so left-anchored wildcard searches are possible (e.g., searching on "A11*" should give you all the A11 call numbers)
    * A range defined by start_of_range and end_of_range should be correct, assuming that the string given for the end of the range is, in fact, a left prefix.

Given the nature of generating normalized sort keys, compatibility between versions is NOT a goal, as any bug-fixes or features will likely require changing the key format.
