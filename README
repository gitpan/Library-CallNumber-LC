Library-CallNumber-LC

Library::CallNumber::LC is mostly designed to do call number normalization, with the following goals:

    * The normalized call numbers are comparable with each other, for proper sorting
    * The normalized call number is a short as possible, so left-anchored wildcard searches are possible (e.g., searching on "A11*" should give you all the A11 call numbers)
    * A range defined by start_of_range and end_of_range should be correct, assuming that the string given for the end of the range is, in fact, a left prefix.

Given the nature of generating normalized sort keys, compatibility between versions is NOT a goal, as any bug-fixes or features will likely require changing the key format.

CHANGELOG

0.20    -Move from fixed to variable length normalization.  This helps:
            -Fix 2-digit decimal limitation (now unlimited)
            -Sort cutters properly when number of digits exceeds 4
                (now unlimited)
            -Overall 27% reduction in sort-key length, on average
        -Improved sorting of numbers in "extra" field
        -Properly recognize numbers which subdivide a class
            -(e.g. BX830 1545 .M3)
        -Make characters used to force items up or down in the sort order
            configurable (defaults to SPACE and TILDE)
        -Add accessor for changing call number text in object instances
